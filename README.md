# 🥋 Ninjas_FinalProject: Data Science and Reproducibility

## Project Overview

This repository holds the final project notebooks and associated data for a course/project on **[Insert Course Name or Project Theme Here]**. The primary focus is on **data analysis, machine learning [or other relevant field]**, and ensuring the **reproducibility** of our findings.

The project is structured around several exercises and a core reproducibility notebook, as demonstrated by the files within this repository.

## Files and Structure

The following files are included in this project:

| Role | Name| Contact/ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Exercise#2_[Name].ipynb` | Analysis notebooks for **Exercise 2**. These typically cover initial data exploration, cleaning, and basic modeling attempts. | Yesterday |
| `Exercise#3_[Name].ipynb` | Analysis notebooks for **Exercise 3**. These typically cover more advanced analysis, model comparison, or specific investigative tasks. | Yesterday |
| `Ninjas_ReproducibilityNotebook.ipynb` | The core notebook demonstrating the complete pipeline, from data loading to final results, specifically focusing on **reproducibility best practices**. | 11 hours ago |
| `amazon_eco-friendly_products.csv` | The primary dataset used for this project, containing information about eco-friendly products from Amazon. | 18 hours ago |
