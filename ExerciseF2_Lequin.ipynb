        "\n",
        "This notebook focuses on the fine-tuning of a pre-trained Transformer model (DistilBERT) to classify eco-friendly product descriptions using the dataset amazon_eco-friendly_products.csv. Fine-tuning allows a language model that has already learned general language representations to adapt its understanding for a specific task—in this case, identifying whether a product is environmentally friendly based on its textual details.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset consists of various product attributes such as titles, materials, and descriptions. These fields are combined and processed using the DistilBERT tokenizer to convert natural language text into tokens that can be interpreted by the model. The task is treated as a binary text classification problem: predicting whether a product is eco-friendly (1) or not eco-friendly (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook represents the “Training Strategy Experiments” portion of the fine-tuning exercise. The experiments systematically adjust key hyperparameters that affect model learning behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "***1. Number of epochs*** – controls how many times the model passes through the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "***2. Learning rate*** – determines how quickly the model updates its weights during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "***3. Batch size*** – defines how many samples are processed before updating model weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "By varying these parameters, the notebook aims to identify the optimal combination that yields the highest F1-Score and Accuracy on the evaluation dataset. The results will help demonstrate how training strategies directly influence the model’s performance and generalization ability.\n",

The stratify=df['label'] makes sure that both sets have a balanced number of eco-friendly and non-eco-friendly samples, so the model doesn’t get biased. After splitting, it creates two new DataFrames: train_data and eval_data, which contain the text and their corresponding labels.

The MODEL_NAME loads the DistilBERT model, which is a smaller and faster version of BERT that still gives good accuracy. The tokenizer converts each product description into tokens — basically turning words into numbers that the model can understand. The function tokenize_function() applies this process to all the text, making sure each text is trimmed or padded to the same length (max_length=128). Then, the training and evaluation data are turned into Hugging Face Dataset objects so they can work smoothly with the model. After tokenizing everything, the DistilBertForSequenceClassification model is loaded with two labels (0 for non-eco-friendly and 1 for eco-friendly) and sent to the device (GPU or CPU). This step basically gets the data and model ready for training."

In this setup, the number of epochs is increased from 3 to 5, meaning the model will train longer and possibly learn more patterns from the data. The learning rate is also lowered from 5e-5 to 3e-5, so the model updates its weights more slowly, which can help it learn more carefully and avoid overfitting. Everything else stays mostly the same as before — same batch size, evaluation each epoch, and saving the best model. After setting these configurations, the Trainer is initialized again and the model is trained and evaluated. The printed results (accuracy and F1-score) will show whether these changes improved or worsened the model compared to the first experiment."

Here, the model is trained for 8 epochs, which means it will go through the entire dataset more times, allowing it to learn deeper patterns. However, the batch size is reduced to 8, meaning the model processes fewer samples per training step — this can make the training slower but may help it generalize better. The learning rate is set back to 5e-5, which makes the updates slightly faster compared to Experiment 2. After defining these settings, a new Trainer is created to handle this experiment’s training and evaluation. The printed results will help compare whether training longer and using smaller batches improved the model’s accuracy and F1-score compared to the earlier experiments."

Each experiment’s settings — like the number of epochs, learning rate, and batch size — are labeled clearly under the “Experiment” column, and the corresponding accuracy and F1-score results from each test are added next to it. After compiling everything, the code saves this table as an Excel file named “Lequin_training_experiments.xlsx” so it can be used later for reporting or comparison. Finally, the results command displays the summary directly in the notebook, making it easier to see which experiment performed best."
